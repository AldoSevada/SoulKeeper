# SoulKeeper

SoulKeeper brings fun to the daunting Warlock task of harvesting soul shards! When soul shards enter your bag; the name, level, and the last words of your victim are mapped to that shard. Tired of miscommunication between summoning and using soul stones? SoulKeeper alerts the entire raid/part of all summons/soul stone casts.
 

## Features
-> Store the name of the victim of your soul shard.<br>
    * Player characters also have their level and a fun quote (last words) associated with them<br>
    * Class colors included!<br>
-> Mouse over details on shards and any conjured stone that display the details of the victim.<br>
-> Personal messages telling you whose soul is used when casting shard consuming spells.<br>
    * Shadowburn, Soulfire, summon pet, health stones, soul stones, etc.<br>
-> Raid/party announcements when summoning and casting soul stone resurrection on players.<br>
    * Announces who is getting the summon/soul stone and whose soul is being used to make it happen!<br>
-> Fun emotes displayed when the soul of a player character is consumed, telling everyone what their last words were!<br>


## Usage
-> '/sk' or '/soulkeeper' to bring up the settings<br>
-> Three options to choose from...<br>
    1. Alerts: Personal messages seen only by you in your chat box detailing the soul used when casting a shard consuming spell.<br>
    2. Emotes: Fun emotes displayed when the soul of a player character is consumed (any soul with last words).<br>
    3. Group Messaging: Send messages to your raid/party when casting 'Ritual of the Summoning'/'Soulstone Resurrection' describing who will get the summon/soul stone and whose soul will be used to do it.<br>  


## Work In Progress
Currently the only known issues are attempting to put your soul shards in the bank. For any shard put into the bank, its data will be reset.<br>
This was a fun project I took up for the experience, I'll do my best to keep it updated in my free time.<br>
Please let me know if you find any bugs or have some recommendations on how I could improve this addon (contact below)!<br>
